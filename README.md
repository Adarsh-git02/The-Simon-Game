# The-Simon-Game
This project is based on The Simon Game!!!

This is how Simon Game works :-

Firstly, the game shows the first colour in the sequence for example blue colour . The user clicks on the blue button.

Next, the game shows the next colour say red, the user has to remember the sequence is blue, red and so on and so forth.

If the user messes up the sequence, then the game ends.

Thank You :)
